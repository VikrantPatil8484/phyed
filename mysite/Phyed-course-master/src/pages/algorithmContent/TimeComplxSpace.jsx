            Time complexity and space complexity are two important measures used
            to analyze the efficiency and resource usage of an algorithm. They
            provide insights into how the algorithm's performance scales with
            input size and help in making informed decisions regarding algorithm
            selection and optimization. Here's a brief explanation of time
            complexity and space complexity, along with their advantages in
            programming:
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify pt-4">1. Time Complexity:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10">
            <li className="pt-4">
              Time complexity measures the amount of time taken by an algorithm
              to run as a function of the input size.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              It helps in understanding how the algorithm's performance degrades
              as the input size increases.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              Time complexity is expressed using big O notation, which provides
              an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means
              that the running time grows linearly with the input size, while
              O(n^2) indicates quadratic growth.
            </li>

            By analyzing the time and space complexities of algorithms,
            programmers can make informed decisions regarding algorithm design,

            evaluating and comparing algorithms, ensuring that the chosen
            solution is efficient and scalable for a given problem and input
            size. Additionally, understanding the resource requirements of an
