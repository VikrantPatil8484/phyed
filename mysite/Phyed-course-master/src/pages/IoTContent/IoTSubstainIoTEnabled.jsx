            <span className="font-semibold">Smart Waste Bins:</span>
            Imagine a city with smart waste bins that use IoT technology. These
            bins have sensors that can detect when they are getting full. When
            the sensor detects that the bin is almost full, it sends a signal to
            the waste management system to schedule a pickup.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            To understand this, picture a waste bin with a small device attached
            to it. This device contains a sensor that measures how full the bin
            is. When the bin reaches a certain capacity, the sensor sends a
            wireless signal to a central system, notifying it that the bin needs
            to be emptied.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            By using smart waste bins, waste management companies can optimize
            their routes and only collect bins when necessary. This reduces
            unnecessary trips, saves fuel, and reduces carbon emissions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">Waste Sorting:</span>
            IoT can also help with waste sorting. Smart bins can have different
            compartments or sensors that identify the type of waste being
            disposed of, such as paper, plastic, or glass. This information is
            sent to the waste management system for proper sorting and
            recycling.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            To visualize this, think of a waste bin with different sections or
            sensors that can recognize the type of waste you're putting into the
            bin. For example, if you put a plastic bottle in a smart bin, the
            sensor can detect that it's plastic and send that information to the
            waste management system.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            The waste management system can then use this information to sort
            the waste properly. It can identify which materials are recyclable
            and ensure they are sent to the appropriate recycling facilities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">Recycling Tracking:</span>
            IoT can also help track and monitor the recycling process. RFID
            (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags or QR codes can be placed on
            recycling bins and containers. These tags or codes can be scanned to
            track the movement of recyclable materials from collection to
            processing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            To understand this, imagine a recycling bin with a small tag or code
            on it. When the bin is collected, the tag or code is scanned, and
            that information is recorded in a database. This helps track the
            recycling journey, from collection to sorting to processing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            By tracking recycling, waste management companies and recycling
            facilities can monitor their processes, measure recycling rates, and
            identify areas for improvement.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            While actual code implementation for IoT-enabled waste management
            and recycling solutions can be complex, kids can engage in hands-on
            activities to understand the concepts. They can create models of
            smart waste bins using cardboard or other materials and experiment
            with sensors and switches to simulate the detection of waste levels.
