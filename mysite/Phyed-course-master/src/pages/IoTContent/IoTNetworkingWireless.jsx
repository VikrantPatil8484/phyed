            Wireless communication technologies for IoT (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
            Zigbee, LoRaWAN)
          </h4>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">1. Wi-Fi:</span> Think of Wi-Fi as a
            special kind of invisible network that allows your devices, like
            phones, tablets, and computers, to talk to each other without any
            wires. It's similar to how you connect to the internet at home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            Wi-Fi uses radio waves to send and receive information between
            devices. These radio waves are like invisible signals that travel
            through the air. Your devices have special parts inside them that
            can send and receive these signals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            Wi-Fi has different channels or frequencies it can use to send
            signals. It's like having different radio stations where each
            station plays different music. Wi-Fi devices need to be set to the
            same channel to talk to each other.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">2. Bluetooth: </span> Bluetooth is
            another wireless technology that allows devices to connect and talk
            to each other over short distances. It's like a magic wire that
            connects devices without actually needing any physical wires.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            Bluetooth is commonly used for things like wireless headphones,
            speakers, and connecting your phone to your car. It uses radio waves
            just like Wi-Fi, but it operates at a different frequency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            One cool thing about Bluetooth is that it can connect to multiple
            devices at the same time. So you can connect your phone to a speaker
            and a smartwatch all at once.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">3. Zigbee: </span>
            Zigbee is a wireless technology specifically designed for smart
            homes and other IoT devices. It's like a secret language that
            devices in your home can use to talk to each other.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            Zigbee devices form a network where they can send messages to each
            other. It's like a big group chat where devices share information.
            This helps devices work together to make your home smarter and more
            convenient.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            Zigbee devices use very little power, so they can run on small
            batteries for a long time. They can also talk to devices that are
            far away, thanks to a special feature called mesh networking. It's
            like having many little helpers that can pass messages along to
            reach faraway devices.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">3. LoRaWAN:</span>
            LoRaWAN is a wireless technology that is used for connecting devices
            that are far away from each other, like sensors on a farm or in a
            city. It's like a super long-range walkie-talkie for devices.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            LoRaWAN uses radio waves just like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but it can
            travel much longer distances. It's perfect for connecting devices
            that are spread out over a large area.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            One interesting thing about LoRaWAN is that it can send small
            amounts of data over long distances while using very little power.
            This is important for devices that need to run on batteries for a
            long time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            These are the main wireless communication technologies used in IoT.
            They each have their special features that make them useful for
            different situations. Just like how you choose different tools for
            different tasks, IoT devices use different wireless technologies
            based on what they need to do.
