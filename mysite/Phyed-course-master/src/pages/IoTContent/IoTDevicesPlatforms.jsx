            AWS IoT is a platform provided by Amazon Web Services that helps you
            connect, manage, and analyze IoT devices and their data. Here's a
            simplified explanation of AWS IoT:

            <li className="pt-4">
              AWS IoT provides a secure and scalable infrastructure for
              connecting and managing IoT devices.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-4">
              It offers device management features, allowing you to securely
              register and organize your IoT devices in the cloud.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-4">
              AWS IoT provides software development kits (SDKs) that help
              developers write code to connect and interact with IoT devices.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-4">
              It supports various communication protocols like MQTT, which
              allows devices to publish and subscribe to messages.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-4">
              AWS IoT also provides services for data processing, storage, and
              analytics, allowing you to analyze and gain insights from the data
              generated by your IoT devices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-justify p-2 pt-4">
            For example, you can use AWS IoT to connect and control a smart
            thermostat from a mobile app, store temperature data in the cloud,
            and analyze the data to identify patterns.

              Google Cloud IoT Core is a service that provides a scalable
              infrastructure for securely connecting and managing devices at
              scale.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-4">
              It integrates with other Google Cloud services, such as Pub/Sub
              for messaging, Cloud Functions for serverless processing, and
              BigQuery for data analytics.
