            Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines or
            computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human
            intelligence. AI enables machines to learn from data, reason, make
            decisions, and even exhibit behaviors that mimic human intelligence.
            Here's a simple breakdown:

              <span class="font-semibold"> The Problem:</span>
              Machines, like IoT devices, often need to make decisions or
              perform tasks based on the data they receive. Traditional
              programming techniques may not be sufficient to handle complex or
              changing situations.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-4">
              <span class="font-semibold">The Solution:</span>
              AI techniques allow machines to learn and adapt from data, making
              them more intelligent and capable of handling various scenarios.
              Instead of being explicitly programmed for every situation,
              machines can learn patterns and make decisions based on that
              learning.

              <span class="font-semibold">Benefits: </span>
              AI in IoT enables devices to become smarter and more autonomous.
              They can analyze data, identify patterns, and make intelligent
              decisions without constant human intervention. This can lead to
              improved efficiency, better predictions, and enhanced automation.

              <span class="font-semibold">Example:</span>
              Let's consider a smart thermostat that adjusts the temperature
              based on user preferences and weather conditions. With AI, the
              thermostat can learn from user behavior, such as when they prefer
              a cooler or warmer temperature, and adjust the temperature
              accordingly.

            <span class="font-semibold">Machine Learning (ML):</span>
            Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and
            models that enable machines to automatically learn from data and
            improve their performance. It involves training a machine learning
            model using data and then using that model to make predictions or
            take actions. Here's a simple breakdown:

              Machines need to make predictions or decisions based on data, but
              we may not know the exact rules or patterns in the data.
            </li>

              Machine learning algorithms analyze and learn from data to
              identify patterns and make predictions. The algorithms
              automatically adjust their parameters to improve performance as
              they receive more data.

              Let's consider a smart camera that detects objects. By training a
              machine learning model with thousands of images labeled as "cat"
              or "dog," the camera can learn to recognize cats and dogs in real
              time.
